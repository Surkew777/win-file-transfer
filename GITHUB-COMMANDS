# Step 1: Verify Username and Password
# Double-check that the username and password are correct.
# Make sure the account has the necessary permissions.
git push

# Step 2: Personal Access Token (Preferred Method)
# Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with 'repo' scope on GitHub.
# Use the token as your password for pushing.
git push https://<username>:<token>@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git

# Step 3: SSH Authentication (Alternative Method)
# Set up SSH keys and add your public key to your GitHub account.
# Update the remote URL to use the SSH URL.
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git

# Step 4: Repository Permissions
# Ensure your GitHub account has write permissions to the repository.
# Check this on the GitHub repository settings under "Manage access."

# Step 5: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
# If you have 2FA enabled, use a Personal Access Token instead of a password.

# After trying the steps above, attempt the git push again.
git push
